# HumanPBMC_Analysis
Aggregate of Human PBMC Isolated from Fixed Whole Blood of a Diseased Donor and a Healthy Donor (Single Cell Gene Expression)

## Background
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) are critical components of the immune system, consisting of lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells) and monocytes. Analyzing PBMCs at the single-cell level can reveal important insights into immune responses and disease mechanisms. This project involves comparing PBMCs from a diseased donor and a healthy donor to identify differences in cellular composition and gene expression.

## Data
The scRNA-seq data used in this project includes PBMCs isolated from fixed whole blood of both a diseased donor and a healthy donor. The dataset comprises raw sequencing reads, processed gene expression matrices, and metadata for each cell.
